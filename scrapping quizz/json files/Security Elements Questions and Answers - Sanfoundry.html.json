    "D choice": "d) Data leakage",
    "answers": "Answer: c",
    "explanations": "Explanation: The term data tampering is used when integrity is compromised in any security model and checking its integrity later becomes costlier. Example: let suppose you sent $50 to an authorised person and in between a Man in the Middle (MiTM) attack takes place and the value has tampered to $500. This is how integrity is compromised."
