    "questions": "15. Passwords need to be kept encrypted to protect from such offline attacks.",
    "A choice": "a) True",
    "B choice": "b) False",
    "C choice": null,
    "D choice": null,
    "answers": "Answer: a",
    "explanations": "Explanation: Physical access is needed in offline attack to the system that is having a password file or the hacker needs to crack the system by other means. Hence, even if hackers gain physical access to the system, if the passwords are in the encrypted mode, it will be almost impossible to steal passwords. "
